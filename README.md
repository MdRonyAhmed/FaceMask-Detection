# FaceMask-Detection
This project is a machine learning-based project focused on the detection of whether a person is wearing a mask or not on their face. The primary objective is to develop an accurate and reliable model for mask detection using Python programming language and the Collaboratory (Colab) platform.

The key steps involved in the project include:

1. Data Collection: Gathering a dataset consisting of images of individuals wearing masks and individuals without masks. This dataset will serve as the basis for training the machine learning model.

2. Data Preprocessing: Performing necessary preprocessing steps on the collected dataset, such as resizing the images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. Model Development: Designing and training a machine learning model using techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The model will learn to distinguish between masked and unmasked faces based on the provided dataset.

4. Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using the testing dataset. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be used to evaluate the model's effectiveness in mask detection.

5. Deployment: Implementing the trained model in a practical setting where it can be utilized to detect masks in real-time. This may involve integrating the model into an application or system that can capture live video or images for mask detection.

Throughout the project, Python and the Colab platform will be utilized to leverage popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, or OpenCV. These libraries provide a range of functionalities for data manipulation, model development, and evaluation.

The ultimate aim of the project is to create a reliable mask detection system that can be utilized in various real-world scenarios to promote public health and safety.
