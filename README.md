# FaceMask-Detection
The goal of this project is to detect a human wear a mask or not in his/her face. To develop the project I have used Python and Collab platform.

# Process
1. First of all we detect the human face from the live camera. Here we have used Haar-Cascades algorithom to detect the human face.
2. Then our model predict that the face has mask or not. We used SVM to build the Machine Learning model.
3. Then it will make a green color square to the face if he/she has worn a mask and red color if he/she has not worn a mask.
